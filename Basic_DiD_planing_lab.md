## 2.
The defense in depth statragy was developed by the nsa to provide a model of security for the cyber world. The DiD model relys on layers with the 3 core layers being administravtice controls, technical controls and physical controls. using thoes core layers you can add more and keep track of all the defense's that attackers have to penetrate.

## 3
having multiple layers of defense makes the attackers job harder in a couple of ways.  the more layers you have and the more obfuscated they are the longer its going to take the attacker to break the system, secondly more layers means theres more chances to catch an attacker early on.

## 4
1. the gate acts as the authentication 
2. the moat and natural defense's act as a fire wall 
3. the look out is a physical layer resembling cctv
4. the archer is the intrusion provention system
5. the gate guards act as a antivirus
